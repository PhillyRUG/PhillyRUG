**Openscapes is an approach for better science for future us**. Better science is science that is more open, reproducible, efficient, and more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and kind. Better science is for “Future Us”: the idea of our teams, and communities, and who will be joining and continuing our work, whether that is next hours, weeks or decades. Future Us is an important mindset for science and society at large, and particularly important in environmental science, because we are tackling huge issues like climate change and climate justice, and we can’t do this alone. Better science for future us is also a real investment, particularly for data-intensive research — this is true in terms of time, money, skillbuilding and safety, so that people are supported to do their best work.

**Openscapes explicitly blends ideas and tooling of open science with diversity equity and inclusion**. While these important topics stand on their own on their own, Openscapes sees them as inextricably interwoven and key to transforming science. Open science is not an inanimate idea - it is for people and thus must be framed around inclusion at every step, from commenting code to onboarding new members to the group. It is a practice of continually recognizing the barriers to participation, whether from systemically excluding women or writing protocols with shorthand that are undefined. Both open science and diversity, equity, and inclusion are a practice, not a checklist; they are mindsets and activities that are continually worked on. 

The Openscapes Champions Program is a professional development and leadership opportunity for teams to explore open data science practices.
